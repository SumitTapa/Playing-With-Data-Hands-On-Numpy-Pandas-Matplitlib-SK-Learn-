# 🛠 Data Wrangling & Preprocessing Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a structured data wrangling workflow using Python and Pandas. 

The notebook focuses on cleaning messy data, handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, transforming features, and preparing the dataset for analysis or machine learning.

The goal is to simulate real-world data preprocessing tasks that are critical before any modeling stage.

## Problem Context
Raw datasets are often incomplete, inconsistent, or noisy.  
This project showcases techniques to transform raw data into a clean and structured format suitable for analysis.

---

## Tasks Performed
- Dataset inspection and structure analysis
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Data type correction
- String and categorical cleaning
- Feature transformation
- Column renaming and restructuring
- Preparing final cleaned dataset

---

## Techniques Used
- Pandas DataFrame operations
- Conditional filtering
- Apply and lambda functions
- Grouping and aggregation
- Data type conversion
- Handling null values (drop / fill)

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
