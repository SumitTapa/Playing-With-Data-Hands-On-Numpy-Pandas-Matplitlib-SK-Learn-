# Tourism & Travel Data Analysis — Interactive EDA (Plotly)

## Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis on a tourism and travel dataset using **interactive visualizations with Plotly**. The notebook focuses on understanding travel patterns, visitor trends, and geographic insights through dynamic charts that enable deeper data exploration compared to static plots.

The goal is to simulate a real-world analytics scenario where stakeholders can visually inspect travel behavior and make data‑driven decisions for tourism planning and marketing.
