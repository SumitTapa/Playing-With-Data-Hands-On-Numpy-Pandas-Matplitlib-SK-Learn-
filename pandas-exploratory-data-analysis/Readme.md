# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas

## Overview
This project demonstrates structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Pandas library in Python.  
The notebook focuses on understanding dataset structure, cleaning data, generating summary statistics, and extracting meaningful insights.

The goal is to simulate a real-world data analyst workflow where raw datasets must be inspected before modeling.
