#  Playing With NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib & Scikit-learn

##  About This Repository

Welcome to my data science sandbox! This repository serves as a **hands-on experimental playground** where I explore and master the core Python libraries that form the foundation of data science and machine learning.

###  What You'll Find Here

This repo documents my journey of learning through practice, featuring:

- ** Experimental Projects**: Various datasets analyzed using different techniques
- ** Data Manipulation**: Pushing the boundaries of NumPy and Pandas
- ** Visualization Gallery**: Creative and insightful plots with Matplotlib
- ** ML Experiments**: Implementation of various algorithms with Scikit-learn
- ** Learning Notes**: Key takeaways and best practices discovered along the way

###  Libraries Covered

| Library | Purpose | Skills Practiced |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **NumPy** | Numerical Computing | Array operations, Broadcasting, Mathematical functions |
| **Pandas** | Data Manipulation | Data cleaning, Transformation, Aggregation, Time series |
| **Matplotlib** | Data Visualization | Custom plots, Subplots, Styling, Publication-ready figures |
| **Scikit-learn** | Machine Learning | Preprocessing, Model building, Evaluation, Pipelines |

###  Goals

-  Build muscle memory for essential data science operations
