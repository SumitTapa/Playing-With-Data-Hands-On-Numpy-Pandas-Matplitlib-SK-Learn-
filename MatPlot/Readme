# 📊 Matplotlib Practice Notebook

## Overview

This repository contains a practice notebook focused on learning and applying data visualization techniques using **Matplotlib** in Python. The goal of this notebook is to build intuition for plotting data, customizing visualizations, and understanding how visual patterns help in data analysis.

The notebook demonstrates fundamental plotting workflows typically used in real-world data science tasks such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), trend identification, and statistical interpretation.

---

## Objectives

* Understand how Matplotlib works internally
* Learn to create different types of plots
* Customize figures (labels, titles, legends, styles)
* Improve data interpretation using visualization
* Build confidence in EDA workflows

---

## Concepts Covered

* Line plots
* Scatter plots
* Bar charts
* Histograms
* Multiple plots in one figure
* Grid, labels, titles, legends
* Figure sizing and styling

## What This Project Demonstrates

This is a **learning-focused notebook** showing step-by-step experimentation rather than a polished production analysis. The emphasis is on understanding visualization behavior and developing intuition for presenting data effectively.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
""" git clone https://github.com/SumitTapa/Playing-With-Data-Hands-On-Numpy-Pandas-Matplitlib-SK-Learn-.git
                                                          OR
# Navigate to the MatPlot directory
cd "Playing-With-Data-Hands-On-Numpy-Pandas-Matplitlib-SK-Learn-/MatPlot""""
2. Install required packages

```bash
pip install numpy wordcloud  matplotlib jupyter
```

3. Open the notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook MatplotLib.ipynb
```

## Learning Outcome

After completing this notebook, you should be able to:

* Choose appropriate plot types for datasets
* Customize charts for clarity
* Perform basic exploratory data analysis visually
* Interpret distributions and relationships in data
