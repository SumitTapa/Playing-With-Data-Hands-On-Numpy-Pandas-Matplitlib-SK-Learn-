# 📈 Seaborn Visualization Practice Notebook

## Overview

This repository contains a practice notebook dedicated to learning statistical data visualization using **Seaborn** in Python. The notebook focuses on understanding how to explore relationships, distributions, and patterns in datasets using high‑level visualization techniques built on top of Matplotlib.

---

## Objectives

* Learn statistical plotting concepts
* Visualize distributions and correlations
* Understand categorical vs numerical relationships
* Improve exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills
* Build intuition for interpreting visual patterns in data

---

## Concepts Covered

* Distribution plots (histplot, kdeplot)
* Categorical plots (boxplot, violinplot, barplot)
* Relationship plots (scatterplot, pairplot)
* Correlation heatmaps
* Styling and themes
* Combining Seaborn with Matplotlib customization

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

This is a learning‑oriented notebook showing hands‑on experimentation with statistical visualization. The focus is on understanding *when and why* to use specific plots rather than producing a final polished report.

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

3. Open the notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook SeaBorn.ipynb
```

---

## Learning Outcome

After completing this notebook, you should be able to:

* Choose suitable plots for different data types
* Detect outliers and skewness visually
* Analyze feature relationships and correlations
* Perform effective exploratory data analysis
